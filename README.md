*   There are some odd characters in the ‚Äòcast‚Äô column. Don‚Äôt worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is
*   The final two columns ending with ‚Äú_adj‚Äù show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

From the analysis, I tried to answer 9 different questions from tmdb movie dataset. 
* Movies with high popularity tend to be profitable.
* There is a very strong correlation between profit and revenue. 
* The movie Avatar directed by  James Cameron is the most profitable in the dataset
* However, Pierre Coffin is the most profitable director in the Dataset
* Jurassic World is the most popular movie
*  The Story of Film: An Odyssey is the movie with the highest vote average
*  Robert De Niro and Samuel L. Jackson acted 72 and 71 movies respectively from 1960 to 2015
*   Movie genre ADVENTURE has the highest popularity (14 times) from 1960 to 2015
* Movie genre DRAMA is the most produce genre(17.74%) from year 1960 to 2015
* It is worth noting that the most popular director doesn't translate to the most profitable director as shown in the  analysis. 
*  Pierre Coffin is the only director in the list most profitable and popular directors.
